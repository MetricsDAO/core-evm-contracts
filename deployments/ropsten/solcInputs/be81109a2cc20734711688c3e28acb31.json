Every `x` blocks, calculate minted Sushi Tokens for each LP contract based on their (shares / total shares)\n 2.  Then, do the math to figure out how many rewards each LP token is worth (based on the total amount of LP tokens staked)\n 3.  Then, when a user requests their rewards, their claimable amount is based on how many tokens they have staked - and from the previous step, we know how many rewards each LP token gets.\n 4.  Historical withdrawals are tracked through \"rewardDebt\" - so subtract the amount of rewards they have already claimed from their total earned rewards.\n\n\nThis contract is a bit more simplified.  Basically there are no LP tokens - so those values are tracked at the top level.\n \n 1.  whenever updateAccumulatedAllocations() is called, we look at how many blocks it's been since the last time it called and multiply that by the `METRIC_PER_BLOCK` value.\n 2.  Then we use that value to determine how much each current \"share\" is going to be earning, and save that as _lifetimeShareValue\n 3.  Then, when an Allocation Group calls Harvest, we figure out how much they've earned based on the _lifetimeShareValue and their current allocation.\n 4.  We track historical harvests through \"debt\" - an AG's Debt is how much they've already harvested, so we subtract that from their lifetime earned rewards to get current earned rewards.\n\n    - OR, Same thing different lens - \n\n 1.  Every `x` blocks, calculate  METRIC Tokens for each AG based on their (shares / total shares)\n 2.  Then, do the math to figure out how many METRIC tokens will be distributed in total\n 3.  Then, when a user requests their rewards, their claimable amount is based on how many shares they have - and from the previous step, we know how many rewards each AG group gets.\n 4.  Historical withdrawals are tracked through \"rewardDebt\" - so subtract the amount of rewards they have already claimed from their total earned rewards.\n\n\n */\n\ncontract Chef is AccessControl {\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\n\n    bytes32 public constant ALLOCATION_ROLE = keccak256(\"ALLOCATION_ROLE\");\n\n    // TODO we probably need this behind a function so it can be dynamic\n    uint256 public METRIC_PER_BLOCK = 4 * 10**18;\n    uint256 public constant ACC_METRIC_PRECISION = 1e12;\n\n    bool private _rewardsActive;\n    AllocationGroup[] private _allocations;\n    uint256 private _totalAllocPoint;\n    uint256 private _lifetimeShareValue = 0;\n    uint256 private _lastRewardBlock;\n\n    MetricToken private _metric;\n\n    constructor(address metricTokenAddress) {\n        _metric = MetricToken(metricTokenAddress);\n        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);\n        _grantRole(ALLOCATION_ROLE, msg.sender);\n    }\n\n    //------------------------------------------------------Manage Allocation Groups\n\n    function addAllocationGroup(\n        address newAddress,\n        uint256 newShares,\n        bool newAutoDistribute\n    ) external onlyRole(ALLOCATION_ROLE) nonDuplicated(newAddress) {\n        if (_rewardsActive && _totalAllocPoint > 0) {\n            updateAccumulatedAllocations();\n        }\n        AllocationGroup memory group = AllocationGroup({\n            groupAddress: newAddress,\n            shares: newShares,\n            autodistribute: newAutoDistribute,\n            rewardDebt: newShares.mul(_lifetimeShareValue).div(ACC_METRIC_PRECISION),\n            claimable: 0\n        });\n\n        _allocations.push(group);\n        _totalAllocPoint = _totalAllocPoint.add(group.shares);\n    }\n\n    function updateAllocationGroup(\n        address groupAddress,\n        uint256 agIndex,\n        uint256 shares,\n        bool newAutoDistribute\n    ) public onlyRole(ALLOCATION_ROLE) {\n        if (_rewardsActive && _totalAllocPoint > 0) {\n            updateAccumulatedAllocations();\n        }\n        _totalAllocPoint = _totalAllocPoint.sub(_allocations[agIndex].shares).add(shares);\n        _allocations[agIndex].groupAddress = groupAddress;\n        _allocations[agIndex].shares = shares;\n        _allocations[agIndex].autodistribute = newAutoDistribute;\n    }\n\n    function removeAllocationGroup(uint256 agIndex) external onlyRole(ALLOCATION_ROLE) {\n        require(agIndex < _allocations.length);\n        if (_rewardsActive && _totalAllocPoint > 0) {\n            updateAccumulatedAllocations();\n        }\n        _totalAllocPoint = _totalAllocPoint.sub(_allocations[agIndex].shares);\n\n        _allocations[agIndex] = _allocations[_allocations.length - 1];\n        _allocations.pop();\n    }\n\n    function toggleRewards(bool isOn) external onlyRole(ALLOCATION_ROLE) {\n        _rewardsActive = isOn;\n        _lastRewardBlock = block.number;\n    }\n\n    //------------------------------------------------------Getters\n\n    function getAllocationGroups() public view returns (AllocationGroup[] memory) {\n        return _allocations;\n    }\n\n    function getTotalAllocationPoints() public view returns (uint256) {\n        return _totalAllocPoint;\n    }\n\n    //------------------------------------------------------Distribution\n\n    function viewPendingHarvest(uint256 agIndex) public view returns (uint256) {\n        AllocationGroup storage group = _allocations[agIndex];\n\n        return group.shares.mul(_lifetimeShareValue).div(ACC_METRIC_PRECISION).sub(group.rewardDebt);\n    }\n\n    function viewPendingClaims(uint256 agIndex) public view returns (uint256) {\n        AllocationGroup storage group = _allocations[agIndex];\n\n        return group.claimable;\n    }\n\n    function updateAccumulatedAllocations() public {\n        require(_rewardsActive, \"Rewards are not active\");\n        if (block.number <= _lastRewardBlock) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // TODO confirm budget is correct with assertions\n        // Not sure we can project emission rate over X years?\n        // Not entirely sure how to handle this, but we can at least try to make it work.\n        // ^^ will help with fuzz testing\n\n        uint256 blocks = block.number.sub(_lastRewardBlock);\n\n        uint256 accumulated = blocks.mul(METRIC_PER_BLOCK);\n\n        _lifetimeShareValue = _lifetimeShareValue.add(accumulated.mul(ACC_METRIC_PRECISION).div(_totalAllocPoint));\n        _lastRewardBlock = block.number;\n    }\n\n    // TODO when we implement the emission rate, ensure this function is called before update the rate\n    // if we don't, then a user's rewards pre-emission change will incorrectly reflect the new rate\n    function harvestAll() public {\n        for (uint8 i = 0;
